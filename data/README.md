# Data

This directory contains data files for use with PastoralScape v0.1 and
earlier.  They are included with the project to allow someone who
downloads the code to have a fully self-contained package that can
run with inputs.  Note that the parameter files may presume
absolute paths into your filesystem, so they will likely need to
be modified to point at this directory.

Future releases will more likely use data stored on an archive 
such as Zenodo or Figshare.
