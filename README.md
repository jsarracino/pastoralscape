ABSTRACT={Modeling realistic human decision-making is an important feature of good policy design processes. The use of an agent-based modeling framework allows for quantitative human decision-models that assume fully rational agents. This research introduces a dynamic human decision-making sub-model. The parameterisation of human memory and “rationality” in a decision-making model represents an important extension of decision-making in ABMs. A data driven model of herd movement within a dynamic natural environment is the context for evaluating the cognitive decision-making model. The natural and human environments are linked via memory and rationality that affect herdsmen decision-making to vaccinate cattle using a once-for-life vaccine (Rift Valley fever) and an annual booster vaccine (Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia). The simulation model uses environmental data from Samburu county, Kenya from 2004 to 2015. The cognitive parameters of memory and “rationality” are shown to successfully differentiate between vaccination decisions that are characterized by annual and once-for-life choices. The preliminary specifications and findings from the dynamic cognition–pastoralist agent-based model (PastoralScape) indicate that the model offers much to livestock vaccination modeling among small-scale herders.}

Execute the model using the scripts in the frontiers_ensemble directory.  Download the accompanying data
file abmdata-2019.tar.gz.  You should adjust the parameter files to point at the data that you unpack.
Future versions of PastoralScape include a cleaner mechanism for integrating data and performing runs.
This prototype does not include those features unfortunately, but is archived to allow for reproduction
of runs from the 2020 Frontiers paper, which was presented as a poster in July 2019.
